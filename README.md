Digipulse Larva Release
-----------------------
This guide will cover the necessary information on how to setup and test the Digipulse Alpha version, codename *Larva*.


Alpha release terms, conditions and meaning
-------------------------------------------
This release is published as *alpha release*. This describes the development status as the first complete public version of our application, wich could be unstable, but is useful to show what the product will do to the initial investors and contributors of Digipulse. Bugs could still occur, and no warranty is given on any of the published code.

To avoid flooding the network, the *larva release* will be limited to the following specs:

  - 100Mb file size limited.
  - No custom dead man switches.
  - All files will be released after 30 minutes.
  - Nodes will not be payed during the *alpha stage* but can share their free space to provide network stability
  - The backend code of our core application will not be disclosed until the ***drone release*** to prevent copycats.

The alpha version will allow you to execute and perform following actions:

  - Join the network as `dpg-node` and share their drives on the network.
  - Create a personal `vault`, store files inside it and make it inheritable.
  - Dead man swith is only available directly to the inheritor's email address during *alpha stage*.
